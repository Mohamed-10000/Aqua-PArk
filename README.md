# Aqua-PArk
Our aim in this project is to make a fun and exciting game for kids to enjoy, using our skills to incorporate all the mechanical, electrical, and manufacturing elements to hopefully design a cohesive product that is functional first and foremost, and have cool design elements integrated in it.
